| Criteria      |   Example |
| --------      |  ---------|
| equal (=)     | =10       |
| less than (<) | <10       |
| more than (>) | >10       |

In the example below, we use **=COUNTIF(C2:C87, "=10")**.

This means to count for values that is equal to 10 in the range of C2:C87 (cell range of Gold category).
